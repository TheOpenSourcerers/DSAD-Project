Unfortunatelly, we realised it should have been a PyCharm project at the end when we were uploading the files.

To install dependencies run in the base folder:
```cmd
virtualenv ./Script/DSADProjVENV; ./Script/DSADProjVENV/Scripts/activate; pip install -r ./Install/libs.txt
```
then run with:
```cmd
python ./Script/Run.py
```
Tip: in Script/config.py you can choose what to show/save
